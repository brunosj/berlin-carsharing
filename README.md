## Description

This repo contains the Berlin Carsharing Price Calculator app, accessible at [berlin-carsharing.landozone.net](https://carsharing.landozone.net).

When public transport takes too long and your bike still needs to be fixed, carsharing options can be interesting.
This app compares prices between different providers based on distance and time.

## Technologies

The app is a minimalist [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) project deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
