## Description

This repo contains the Berlin Carsharing Price Calculator app, accessible at [carsharing.landozone.net](https://carsharing.landozone.net).

When public transport takes too long and your bike still needs to be fixed, car sharing options can be interesting.
This app compares prices between different providers based on distance and time (with an additional parameter for airport pick-up/drop-off)

## Technologies

This app is a minimalist [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) project deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Installation

1. Use the git CLI to close the repo

# or

```
